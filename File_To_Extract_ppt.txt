My God, how wonderful Thou artFREDRICK W FABER[1814-63]The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holyIs 57:15My God, how wonderful Thou art!Thy majesty how bright!How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,In depths of burning light! 2 How dread are Thine eternal years,O everlasting Lord,By prostrate spirits day and nightIncessantly adored!3 How dread I fear Thee, living God,With deepest, tenderest fears,And worship Thee with trembling hopeAnd penitential tears! 4 Yet I may love Thee, too, O Lord,Almighty as Thou art,For Thou hast stooped to ask of meThe love of my poor heart.  5 No earthly father loves like Thee;No mother, e’er so mildBears and forbears as Thou hast doneWith me, Thy sinful child. 6 How wonderful, how beautiful,The sight of Thee must be,Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,And awful purity!-END-
